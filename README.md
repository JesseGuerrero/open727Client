# Open 727 Client (Darkan Game Client)

This is a work in progress towards refactoring an obfuscated version of the Runescape game client that dates back to mid 2012 (Client build #727). It is also being used as the game client for my 2012 emulation project called Darkan.

The Darkan website can be found at https://darkan.org
